# Requirements
1. Matlab (2014 or above)
2. CoppeliaSim Edu

# Getting Started
1. First open the matlab script 'EXPERIMENTATION_threemode.m'
2. Then open the desired vrep scene 'Final _without_obstacles.ttt' or 'Final_with_obstacles.ttt'
which is designed with 6 robots. You can change robots initial position anywhere in the scene.
Even can change number of robot or environment.
(If number is of robot needs to increase then one can copy and paste a robot in the scene
to maintain same property. For lesser number one can simply delete any robot.)
3. Press 'Start' button in vrep scene.
4. Now press 'Run' button in vrep script.

N.B: Before running script you should check 'number_of_robots' variable match with
vrep scene.
