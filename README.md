# Symswarm:Symmetrical-Pattern-Formation-in-a-Swarm-of-Mobile-Robots
Symswarm is a symmetrical modular pattern formation algorithm which is for  used to construct a symmetrical pattern among multiple mobile robots. The modular  algorithm is divided into two phases where first phase is self guided independent phase and second phase is the swarm coordination phase between robots.
